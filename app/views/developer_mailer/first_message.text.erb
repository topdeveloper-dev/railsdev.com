Hey, <%= @developer.first_name %>,

I'm Joe, the solo-founder of railsdevs. You received your first message from a business today. Congratulations!

Here are some tips to make the most of the conversation:

  1. Respond to every message. Let a business know if you aren't interested.
  2. Don't be afraid to ask for salary or budget early in the process.
  3. Feel free to move the conversation to video chat to get to know each other.
  4. Finally, when you land your first gig let me know by responding to this email!

Don't hesitate to reach out if you run into issues or need help using railsdevs.
