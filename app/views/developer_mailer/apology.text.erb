Hey <%= @developer.first_name %>,

I'm Joe, the solo-founder of railsdevs. You may have received multiple emails asking if your profile is up to date.

You should have only gotten one. Yesterday I introduced a bug that caused this to occur. I fixed it this morning but not before the emails went out.

Bug fix: https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.com/pull/463

I apologize for clogging your inbox and sending another email.
