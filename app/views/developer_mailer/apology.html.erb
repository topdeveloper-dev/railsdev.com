<p>Hey <%= @developer.first_name %>,</p>
<p>I'm Joe, the solo-founder of railsdevs. You may have received multiple emails asking if your profile is up to date.</p>
<p>You should have only gotten one. Yesterday I introduced a bug that caused this to occur. I <a href="https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.com/pull/463">fixed it this morning</a> but not before the emails went out.</p>
<p>I apologize for clogging your inbox and sending <i>another</i> email.</p>
