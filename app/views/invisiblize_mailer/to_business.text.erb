Hey <%= @business.name %>,

I'm Joe, the founder of railsdevs (<%= root_url %>). Your business profile (<%= notification_url(@notification.record) %>) was flagged because it doesn't contain enough information and kind of looks like spam.

I've set your profile to invisible – only you can see it. Let me know when you update your profile and I will make it public again.

Questions? Respond to this email and I can help.
