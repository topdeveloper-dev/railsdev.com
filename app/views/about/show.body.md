### Empowering the developer

I've been an independent developer for the past two years. And leads are rarely consistent. Sometimes I can't keep up with the work and other times I struggle to find my next gig.

And job boards are rarely helpful for freelance and contract work. They're focused on full-time roles.

**railsdevs** strives to give power back to the independent developer. Instead of companies posting their jobs, developers post their profiles. That way, the power dynamic is reversed as companies have to reach out to developers first.

### Doing everything in public

**railsdevs** is [open source](https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.io/) with public [analytics](https://app.usefathom.com/share/cacnfaan/railsdevs.io) and [bug reports](https://app.honeybadger.io/project/EKRGgkQdR0).

On top of that, I'm making all my decisions in public. I'm posting questions and ideas when I'm looking for feedback on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.io/discussions). And I'm tweeting about work in progress (and sneak previews) [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti).

### Creating a safe, inclusive environment

The site is open to all developers, regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, or skill level.

If something doesn't feel right, or you ever feel uncomfortable, please [send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) right away.
