# Database seeds for local development

The goal of the database seeds is to make local development easier. They help create an environment that is representative, but not a replica, of production.

The password for all accounts is `password`.

### Developers

The "named" developers cover most states of each field on the profile. There are also 20 developers that are randomized to encourage testing of pagination.

* `developer@example.com` - The "core" developer with a complete profile, in a conversation with a business, and has sent and received messages.
* `minimum@example.com` - Their developer profile only has the absolute minimum needed to fill out the form.
* `freelancer@example.com` - Available soon, open to offers, and looking for contract work.
* `junior@example.com` - Actively looking for full-time junior roles.

### Businesses

* `business@example.com` - The "core" business with an active subscription, in a conversation with a developer, and has sent and received messages.
* `lead@example.com` - A business with a complete profile but no subscription.

### Users

There is one admin account that is not associated with a developer nor a business.

`admin@example.com`
