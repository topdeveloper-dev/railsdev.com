# Contributing

See the [Roadmap project](https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.io/projects/2) to see where you can contribute. All cards in the backlog are issues â€“ feel free to comment on one to let others know you might be working on it.

This project uses [Standard](https://github.com/testdouble/standard) for formatting Ruby code. Please make sure to run `bundle exec standardrb --fix` before submitting pull requests to enforce code style on commit.
